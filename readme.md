## Football images

The goal of this project is to build software that takes in images of NFL plays, and extracts information about the play.

The first phase is focused on pre-snap information, due to the fact that the "pre-snap" state of a NFL play is relatively static and well defined.

Some types of information I am targetting:
- was the offense in shotgun?
- For each of the following offensive positions, how many were on the field, and how were they aligned?
    - RB
    - TE
    - WR
- Was their motion?
- How was the defense aligned?
- Did the defense show blitz?
- Did the defense actually blitz?


On their own these elements may have limited value, but taken together they provide rich, valuable information that isn't widely available.
